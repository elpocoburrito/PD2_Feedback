# Shapeshifting druid 

## Early game

**With gear equivalent to a player that isnt at his first playthrough without being very very rare or costly.**

Early levels as a wolf shapeshifter, up to level 6 were not super fast nor super slow. At level 6, the feral rage allowed for much faster clear and leveling. Damage was good yet not too big. Never felt too strong or too weak during leveling up to Duriel around level 16. Used many common unique weapons and common rares/uniques armor pieces and had decent success, although clear speed got slower in early act 2 since I had a weaker weapon. I was pretty tanky and it went smoothly. I swapped to fire druid around level 19 to see cow clear speed. the cow clearing speed was very fast with average gear and probably slightly overtuned, mana cost was very low relatively to the damage i was spitting out. reverted to shapeshifter at level 26 after ancients. Leveled slowly up to 31 with an average weapon (Griswold edge) while duo with a barbarian. At 31 I equipped a Ribcracker and had very large damage which felt very strong but since my weapon wasn't what people would use on a first playthrough, i think it might be fair. From act 1 normal to act 5 nm, the skill pts repartition I used was pretty evenly spread points between werewolf, lycanthropy, feral rage and fury. Had no mana issues beside early in act 1 and 2 normal, which is normal for a low level character.

## Mid game

**With pretty strong gear that would require a fair bit of farming**

Slowly turning into Memester SSDruid; of course the items i am using are not what a first playthrough player would have. SS wolf feral+fury with the following gear at level 31 (only key items): String of ears belt, Ribcracker (with or without 1-2os corruption with shaels), Goblin toe (def not essential tbh) and Bloodfist gloves. Damage was great, attack spead breakpoint: very fast, tankiness and sustain very good, clear speed fairly decent. impressive for a melee character. The turning point was the Ribcracker from what point everything was quite easy. Around level 34, I corrupted my Ribcracker for 2 open sockets and placed 2 shaels which gave me the weapon i used to tore through everything up to nm act 5 without issues. Stomp all the way to act 5 nm, which is where I currently am and still stomping enemies. Jalals mask is a very GG item with big benefits but other cheap alternatives would be plenty to go at least to nm act 5 without issues. monsters die very fast. Tested other weapons for fun: storm rider axe was very good and efficient but attacked much slower than Ribcracker. If wealthy/lucky, can be corrupted for sockets and get a few shaels dropped into it which leads to very fast and easy clear in nm act 5 at levels as low as 40. Hellmouth gloves are a great way to get even more fun with the additional boulder and meteor procs which do some damage, although not the main source. I plan on testing multi-socket windforce to see viability of twister spam. With lategame gear, I was able to clear easily in act 5 nm with 180 unspent stat points (no vitality investment, only required str for gear) at around lvl 42.

## Hell difficulty

**GG gear, the kind that would clear ubers in vanilla and PoD**

When i reached hell, around level 60, I ran into a brick wall. Using *very* good gear, i was dying in blood moor every 4 minutes. I went back to nm baal running and rerolled gear improvements, respec'd to optimise and worked very hard. Using a perfect jalals with 1 Um and a cold res corruption, 4@ res corrupted gore riders, good roll of string of ears, hellmouth gloves, highlord corrupted for cold res, an almost perfect ravenfrost and a carrion ring, i was totally unable to clear blood moor/cold plains alone without the shouts of my barb duo. I tested multiple other weapons including an Ice great bow, a 3os 3shaels stormriders and a few others, i had **extremely** bad results in hell. Me and my duo both had gear that should be able to solo chaos in vanilla and PoD and in my case, my gear, beside gloves, could even do ubers. (gloves would need to be draculs in PoD/Vanilla to do ubers). For hell difficulty, i used wolf SS with maxed out fury, maxed out lycantropy, maxed out wolf form and about 6-8 points into feral rage. I tested multiple variation of those skill investment with no success. I wasn't using oaks, its the only thing i have not tested as i felt i needed to invest my points into the core skills.





# Trap sin

**WIP notes for light trap sin**

## level 1-6

Cannot say much, i played martial up to 6 but was easy with only basic attack so no complaints.

## level 6-12

Kinda average speed, reasonable mana cost, maybe slightly high as i cannot spam shock web much, but the damage of shockweb was pretty good and thus i dont see issues.

## Level 12-16

bolt sentry has massive mana cost and unimpressive damage. I think lowering the mana cost slightly could do wonders. using lenymo and a bunch of rares found on the ground.
